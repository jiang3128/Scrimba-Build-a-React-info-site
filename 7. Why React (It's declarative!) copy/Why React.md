# Why React
## React is composable
React allow us to write Composable code - sculpting, using small pieces of bricks to finish the whole software or app
Put codes into custom components, and can be reused within the project.
## React is declarative
Oposite of Imperative, when a program is declarative, we can tell the program what should be done. Imperative is how should it be done - describe every steps on how to do something.
