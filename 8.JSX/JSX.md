# Why React
## React is composable
React allow us to write Composable code - sculpting, using small pieces of bricks to finish the whole software or app
Put codes into custom components, and can be reused within the project.
## React is declarative
Oposite of Imperative, when a program is declarative, we can tell the program what should be done. Imperative is how should it be done - describe every steps on how to do something.
## JSX
JSX - Javascript XML, kind of like a function that when its run, returns the object that react can interpret and use to create actual elements on the screen
With JSX, we need to only return a single parent element, can not render a sibling tags side by side, we need a div on both of them and it will run 
You can safe codes as variable
